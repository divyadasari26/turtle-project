# turtle-project
This project uses the Python Turtle graphics module. By combining geometric logic and visual perspective, we create the illusion of three-dimensional objects like a cube, cylinder, and pyramid. The project demonstrates the use of basic turtle commands, loops, and coordinate manipulation to mimic 3D visual effects.
